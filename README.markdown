I'm learning [Xiki](http://xiki.org/), bit by bit. Maybe an hour a week, nothing much.

I'm a serious n00b, but I'm sharing what I've learnt regardless. I am taking notes, using Xiki's built in notes feature.

To use in Xiki:

  1. Clone this repo as your Xiki notes folder (`~/xiki/notes`)
  2. `xsh`
  3. In Xiki type `^` on a blank line then hit Control-X to expand the list of notes
  4. Navigate using the arrow keys, expand things using Control-X

You should probably read the keys and getting started documentation first... it'll help a little bit. Maybe.
